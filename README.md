# ringclock
A clock with Neopixel LED rings and Raspberry Pi
This project uses Adafruit's Neopixel LEDs to create a ring shaped clock with a Raspberry Pi. Additionally, the clock functions as a lamp controlled by an IR-remote and uses a light sensor for adaptive Brightness

## external libs required for this project:
- the LED lib can be found [here](https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x)
